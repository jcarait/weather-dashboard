## Why build this project?

In week 06 of the Coding Bootcamp at University of Sydney, I've been learning about working with server-side APIs. This project works with public APIs to display data on a web page in the form of a dashboard.

## Features

- Uses a public weather API to get weather data
- Displays basic weather data which includes current data and 5-day forecast
- Vanilla Javascript
- Mobile CSS Design
- Seach history function
